## A conversation between Jamila and Bugcrowd

7AM Jamila: Hi, I'm expressing my interest in the Junior Security Engineer (Aus) position at Bugcrowd, but it seems like your site is down! 
  (Jamila inspires a sense of urgency before the company is fully awake and thinking clearly early in the morning)

7:30AM Company: Great! Please apply at https://www.bugcrowd.com/about/careers/

7:31AM Jamila: I can't access the link. Is there another form of contact? Otherwise, does this link seem to work for you on your end? https://www.buqcrowd.com/about/careers/
  (Jamila tries to typosquat with another hosted domain which may redirect elsewhere)
  
7:32AM Company: Here is the contact for our HR hr@bugcrowd.com and of our CEO davegerry@bugcrowd.com
  (Jamila sends a malicious email with a file called "Jamila-Tomines-Resume" which is trojan horse)
